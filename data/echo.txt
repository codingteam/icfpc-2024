The School of the Bound Variable provides a special echo service for you. If you send an ICFP expression evaluating to:

```
echo <some text>
```

it will respond with `<some text>`.

Hint: you can use this to validate the Macroware Insight evaluator has the expected behavior. Of course the usual limitations still apply.
